# Handle-Imbalanced_Datasheets

In this repository, we explore techniques to address the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets in machine learning, with a particular focus on the application of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for bank churn prediction.

## The Problem of Imbalanced Datasets

Imbalanced datasets, where one class (often the minority class) has significantly fewer samples than the other class, are common in real-world applications. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class, even if they achieve high overall accuracy.

## Approaches to Handling Imbalance

Several strategies can be employed to mitigate the effects of class imbalance:

* **Resampling Techniques**
    * **Oversampling:**  Increase the number of samples in the minority class.
        * **SMOTE:** Creates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing minority class data points.
    * **Undersampling:**  Decrease the number of samples in the majority class.
    * **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine oversampling and undersampling techniques.

* **Algorithmic Modifications**
    * **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Assign different misclassification costs to different classes, penalizing errors on the minority class more heavily.
    * **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models trained on different subsets or resampled versions of the data.

## Application: Bank Churn Prediction

We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMOTE in a real-world scenario - predicting customer churn in the banking industry. 

* **Dataset:**  The dataset is inherently imbalanced, with a significantly lower proportion of customers who churned compared to those who didn't. 
* **Methodology:** 
    * We employed Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as our primary machine learning model for churn prediction.
* To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we experimented with two approaches:
    * **SMOTE Oversampling:** Synthetically generated new samples for the minority class (churned customers) using SMOTE.
    * **SMOTE + Undersampling:** Combined SMOTE oversampling with undersampling techniques to balance the dataset.
* We trained and evaluated ANN models on both the original imbalanced dataset and the balanced datasets generated using the two approaches.
* Model performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a particular focus on the minority class (churned customers).

## Results

* **SMOTE:** Showcased improvement in the model's ability to identify churned customers compared to the baseline model trained on the imbalanced data.
* **SMOTE + Undersampling:**  Further enhanced performance, achieving a better balance between overall accuracy and the ability to detect churn.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of addressing class imbalance in machine learning and demonstrates the effectiveness of SMOTE and hybrid resampling techniques in improving model performance, especially for the minority class.
